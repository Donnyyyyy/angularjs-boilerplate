A complete, yet simple, starter for AngularJS using Webpack.

This workflow serves as a starting point for building AngularJS (1.x) applications using Webpack 2.x. Should be noted that apart from the pre-installed angular package, this workflow is pretty much generic.

* Heavily commented webpack configuration with reasonable defaults.
* ES6, and ES7 support with babel.
* Source maps included in all builds.
* Development server with live reload.
* Production builds with cache busting.
* Testing environment using karma to run tests and jasmine as the framework.
* Code coverage when tests are run.
* No gulp and no grunt, just npm scripts.

>Warning: Make sure you're using the latest version of Node.js and NPM

### Quick start

> Clone/Download the repo then edit `app.js` inside [`/src/app/app.js`](/src/app/app.js)

```bash
# clone our repo
$ git clone https://github.com/preboot/angularjs-webpack.git my-app

# change directory to your app
$ cd my-app

# install the dependencies with npm
$ npm install

# start the server
$ npm start
```

go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

This boilerplate based on [angularjs-webpack](https://github.com/preboot/angularjs-webpack).
